# Minimal workspace plan (example)

This is a tiny example `plan.md` you can register as a workspace to verify the UI end-to-end.

Suggested demo tasks:

1) Ask the agent to summarize this workspace.
2) Ask the agent to create a new file `hello.txt` with a short message (requires write access).
3) Ask the agent to list files and explain what it changed.
